Miscellaneous
====================

This repo contains a few miscellaneous scripts generally created to implement algorithms or convince myself empirically of various results. Mostly these are connected to the UCL CSML course 14-15, but I intend to add more scripts now, since most written so far could not be shared for reasons of plagiarism.
